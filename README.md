# Fault Finder StreetLights Monitoring System

Fault Finder is an innovative project aimed at monitoring street lights in real-time using modern technology. This project was developed as part of the FITT IoT 5G program by IIT Delhi, incorporating Node-RED for enhanced functionality.

## Overview

The Fault Finder system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller and light sensors to detect the status of street lights. The data is transmitted wirelessly to a central hub via Wi-Fi and MQTT protocol. The hub, powered by Node-RED and Hive, provides centralized control and alerts authorities instantly in case of any issues. 

## Key Features

- Real-time monitoring of street lights
- Wireless communication using Wi-Fi and MQTT protocol
- Centralized control and instant alerts via Node-RED and Hive
- Smooth functionality ensured through rigorous testing using Wokwi online simulator.

## Technology Stack

- ESP32 microcontroller with Wi-Fi capabilities
- LDR sensors for light detection
- MQTT protocol for message transmission
- Node-RED for visual programming
- Hive as the MQTT broker
- Wokwi online simulator for testing and simulation.
